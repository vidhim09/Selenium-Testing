Implicit Wait:
--------------
During Implicit wait if the Web Driver cannot find An element immediately because of its availability,
it will keep polling (around 250 milli seconds) the DOM to get the element.
If the element is not available within the specified Time an NoSuchElementException will be raised.
It generally waits for the whole DOM tree to load.
We generally have only one implicit wait and that is used in the beginning.

Syntax:
-------
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Explicit Wait:
---------------
There can be instance when a particular element takes more than a minute to load.
It is specified for a particular element and waits for that element to load rather than the whole DOM Tree.
We can have multiple explicit wait for different components.

Syntax:
-------
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("someid")));
